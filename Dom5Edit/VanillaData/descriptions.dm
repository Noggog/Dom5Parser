But his obsession with memories didn't stop with that. Soon he would try to make the dead speak of their memories, for the dead do not forget. Golog has now created himself a mummified host of living memories. Each month, more and more of his mummified servants gather to tell stories of ancient times, when humans were not. His denunciation of the New God has robbed him of his former Oracular status and influence."

He traveled far and wide and visited many courts of the time, where he mastered the art of diplomacy. When he heard rumors of the opulent halls and magical riches of Agartha, he decided to make them his. Agartha was a broken nation in need of guidance and he felt a need to guide them. By gathering mages who had fled the Iron Inquisition and with economic aid from the Emerald Emperor of Pythium, he organized the human conquest of the cavern realm of Agartha. He orchestrated the reforming of Agarthan society and created the Golem Cult for his fugitive mages. He made himself a power behind the Oracles and rules the Golem Crafters with iron hand and silver tongue. He alone among the humans remembers how the Cult was formed and how the Oracles accepted human worship. Klaus now serves the Emerging God, certain that it will further his interests and power. Klaus is a skilled diplomat and spy, should he care to venture outside his opulent chambers. He is also a most skilled mage-smith and Golem Crafter.

When the worms and bugs that feed of carrion devour the corpse of a dead Nature mage, some of those mages manage to transfer a portion of their mind and power into the crawling mass feeding on their remains. This being houses the life force of such a mage and it is formed by thousands of worms and bugs. Should it be slain in combat its body will dissolve into a myriad of bugs that will still contain the life force of the mage. If left undisturbed it will not take long for the mage to form a new body capable of casting spells. The Worm Mage can also enter the sea and when doing so it will simply make use of shrimps and other underwater bugs instead of the usual beetles and worms."

The other inhabitants of the city were not allowed to advance to royalty, but they were still considered semi-divine by the Machakans. Some of the Colossi continued to live in comfort, but some found themselves worshipped as sacred warriors of unequaled strength. Armed with ancient weapons and pelts from Kithaironic Lions they marched with the armies of Machaka and conquered every tribe, city and kingdom they came across. Every Lion Warrior wears a Kithaironic Lion pelt and wields a sacred spirit club. When a warrior dies, his arms are returned to his family and his sons enter a ritual battle to determine who shall inherit his father's place as a sacred warrior. To make sure there is a worthy candidate, each warrior is supposed to beget as many sons as possible. Since most sons die in the battle there is a surplus of female Colossi and most warriors marry at least a dozen wives."

Their strength and combat prowess was easily recognizable, but they didn't show any interest or aptitude for magic. That was before the arrival of Atun Shar, the Sobek Sauromancer. When the Sauromancers were replaced with Marshmasters, the Sauropeums where Sauromancers were trained and initiated into the mysteries fell into disuse, and Death magic became less frequent in the kingdom. Atun Shar was found meditating in a ruined Sauropeum in the depths of the temple marsh, dressed in a black robe and a royal headdress of unknown origin. When approached by the Marshmasters he claimed to be the promised Sauromancer of the Seventh Book. The fact that there are only six sacred books made the high priests and the Marshmasters concerned, but on the other hand Atun Shar couldn't be charged with sacrilege. He was indisputably powerful and his skills were needed in the sacred war for the Awakening God. Now he serves the Awakening God, but many suspect that he also has his own agenda."

When a noble dies his wife is expected to take her life to be embalmed together with her husband's remains and kept in a tomb palace. Rich families can afford to construct entire wings for important ancestors, while poorer families only keep a room for the deceased. The Mallqui is brought forth at important events and feasts and it is not uncommon that entire halls are filled with mummy bundles sitting and dining in silence during great feasts. The embalming ritual preserves the will and spirit of the deceased and the dead are supposed to be wiser than the living. Although the Mallqui cannot speak, the Nazcan priests divine his will and aid the family to act according to the will of their ancestors. Being older and dead, and therefore wiser, the Mallqui can demand a higher stipend than he did in life. Recently some influential nobles have warned the Inca that the stipends and lands controlled by the ancestors might ruin the kingdom. The priests have protested and called it nonsense. Several of the nobles were sacrificed and their bodies were destroyed rather than being mummified. When brought into battle the Mallqui is carried by a couple of bearers paid by his stipends."

When the merging is complete the mind of the host is completely gone and the body is no longer human. The resulting composite being is called an Androleth.

A problem with the magical metal is that it reeks with fumes detrimental to living beings. The barrels are often given to the reawakened dead and placed far from living soldiers."

#selectitem "SwordofInjustice"
#descr "A simple sword of ordinary appearance, this blade was once not unlike other swords. After it was worn and wielded by the Grand Censor of Ermor who used it to mete out his depraved justice, it acquired considerable power from the innumerable innocents that died on its blade. The residue of these injustices residing in the blade was enhanced during the cataclysmic fall of Ermor, when it absorbed considerable amounts of unholy energy. The sword will now increase the holy might of its wielder and will strike anyone it hits with the rot of Hell. It also enables the owner to protect his undead minions from banishment."

#descr "This is a round shield of hardened leather with tufts of goat hair surrounding its edge. Upon the leather surface, the unknown maker painted an extremely vivid image of the Medusa. The image is so vivid that anyone who meets the mad gaze of the painted eyes will be instantly petrified. Anyone fighting the Aegis-bearer tries to avoid the leering face of the Medusa and will thus have trouble watching and predicting the Aegis-bearer's actions."
#end

#selectitem "TheAnkh"
#descr "Also known as the Amulet of Life, the Ankh was made in ancient times to cheat Death of its prize. The mere presence of the Ankh prohibits the souls of the dead from leaving this world.

The powers of the Amulet of Life are so strong that the wearer may decide who will die and who will continue to fight when Death calls."

#end

#selectitem "TheAstralHarpoon"
#descr "An ancient harpoon made of bone with a tip of rusted iron. Tied to it is an ominous silver string. No one knows who made this ancient weapon. Perhaps it was even crafted by Horrors, given what is known of its deadly powers. It will travel through the ether until it reaches the destination specified by its wielder, and there it will strike its target. Then, the user yanks the string and its hooked prey is pulled back through the ether to where the user awaits. However, he user must beware, for if the harpoon hits a prey too mighty, the prey might yank him through the ether instead. The skill used for utilizing the harpoon is a combination of strength and Astral magic, and being very strong usually trumps normal strength and mediocre magic abilities."

Inanimate beings cannot use magic hearts."
#end

#selectitem "TheBlackMirror"
#descr "This magic mirror is cracked by the tension between the Astral magic used to forge the mirror and the magic from the bloodsoaked frame. If brought to battle, the mirror will instantly dispel any illusions and phantasms at the cost of making its user somewhat vulnerable to enemy magic.

#end

#selectitem "TheFirstCrown"
#descr "It may be that there were other crowns made before this one, but they were certainly nowhere near as perfectly crafted. The crown is made from the finest gold and set with the very best gems. In fact the crown is so perfect that all the great smiths claim that only one of their lineage could have made something this great. Some say it was crafted by the gods and some say the Pantokrator conquered it in a fight on another plane. Its true origin is unknown, but wise mages say that its construction has been heavily influenced by horrors and that only the wisest of the wise would be able to wear this crown without being destroyed."

#descr "This stolen piece of the Sun contains enormous power that can greatly enhance the wielder's skills in Astral and Fire magic, but this Sun material is very sought after by astral beings. In combat, the Forbidden Light will shine with a holy light that slays undead and blinds everyone else. The wielder of the Forbidden Light will grow older at an accelerated age, but that is unlikely to be his cause of death because many Horrors will also seek possession of this precious item. Any province where this piece of light is, will always count as if it is in the presence of the sun."

#selectitem "TheSharpestTooth"
#descr "This is the sharpest tooth from the most venomous Wyrm ever known to have lived. It is now empowered with two sets of runes. The first amplifies the potency of the tooth's venom and enhances the poison resistance of its wielder. The second rune will grant the wielder extreme patience and enhanced awareness of his surroundings, which can make an assassin extremely efficient. There is no handle as such, but the base of the tooth is wrapped in angel skin to nullify the otherwise baneful effect on the wielder. It is so venomous that it will affect even poison-immune creatures."
#end

#selectitem "TheSicklewhoseCropisPain"
#descr "A sickle made from beaten bronze with runes inscribed along its edges and a blood-groove running down the center of the blade, this tool is not used to cut rye or wheat.

#end

#selectitem "TheTartarianChains"
#descr "The ancient god who once wore these chains is unknown, but the purpose of the chains is not. They once held a fallen god captive in the Underworld, but he apparently broke free, since the chains now exist in the world of men. Some of the power of their captive is still retained in the black iron of their coils. When swung, the chains hit with tremendous force, but their primary power is that anyone surviving the force of the blow runs the risk of having his soul enslaved to the wielder of the chains. The chains have a downside, though. Anyone who wields these chains will soon find himself attacked by guards from the Underworld."
