# Dom5Parser

This is a C# project primarily aimed at merging mods together. End-usage is for a large mod project to allow merging many nations together.
This tackles that by building in features to bypass dominions limitations - such as the notorious mage limitation, but also remapping ID's.
It has many tacked on features for private usage, but as I go I will build a more polished version for usage.

# Usage
* Download the latest release and run the exe included.
* Follow the instructions inside - primarily give it the mod folder, import mods, customize nations you want to cut, merge and export.

# License
* MIT license / public domain but just give me some credit somewhere for politeness!
